      I'm currently a final year PhD candidate at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html" target="_blank">The University of Auckland</a>, researching deep learning techniques to recognise human emotions with smart devices.
      I also completed my Master of Engineering degree at the same university, investigating machine learning algorithms with wearable sensors.

      My career started as an aspiring software engineer in 2016, and since then, I have worked in Sri Lanka, Singapore and New Zealand.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
